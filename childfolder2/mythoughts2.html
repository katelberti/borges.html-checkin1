<p>I think the reason this short story inspired hypertext is because of the way it speaks about alternative outcomes.  Doctor Albert - the man who has read Tsun's ancestor's writing - talks about how he figured out that the book and the labyrinth are one in the same because .  The whole concept is talking about how you must consider all possible outcomes and I think that's the biggest point technology-driven individuals took from the story: there's never just one option. There's always a way to expand a story or dig deeper.</p>
